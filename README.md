# Introduction

This is a responsive website for a fake travel company offering tours in the Canadian North, using the React framework. It demonstrates the use of a hero section with a video background, responsive cards, a navigation menu, and a subscription box. Many Components have been created using reusable sub-components and passed as parameters (props) to templates, which then render them. It also exhibits different behavior on computer vs mobile screens based on screen width.
